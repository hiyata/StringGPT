# StringGPT
Very simple ChatGPT integration into String Protein Database. 
This is part of an ongoing project to integrate String, Reactome, and Uniprot with ChatGPT

Add your open AI key in app.py and run it.

Using a web browser, navigate to the local host and type in any protein. You will get a simple output of the information from String, and chat-GPT's response.
